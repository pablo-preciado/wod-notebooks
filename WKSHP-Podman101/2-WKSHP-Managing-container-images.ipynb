    "\n",
    "First we have specified the \"FROM\" option, this line is mandatory, you need it to build your container image. With this line we specify the base container image that we will use for our application, in our example we've chosen a redhat/ubi9 image as base for our application. Choosing an image that you can trust is critical to maintain a secure environment, if your base image has vulnerabilities it may affect your application and potentially your whole enviroment. This is why we have chosen a Red Hat Universal Base Image (UBI) image for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 (RHEL9).\n",
    "\n",
    "Red Hat creates UBI images that are analyzed often and gives you information about the vulnerabilities that it may have and how to solve them. There are many options for your UBI images, from the standard RHEL 8 or RHEL 9 to a much more secure micro image and even images for specific types of applications (like http, nodejs, etc). You can find a detailed list of all the CVE's and security status of Red Hat's UBI images in [Red Hat's catalog](https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/search).\n",
    "Also, if you're a Red Hat customer you will have full support for these images. But, if you're not, do not worry as some of this images are also uploaded to docker.io so you can access them and have enterprise grade security in your containers for free.\n",
    "\n",
    "![redhatcatalog](Pictures/certifiedcontainers.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "With that we know that our application will be running on top of a trusted and secured container image. Now we need to add our software layer. To do so we added the second line in which we used the \"RUN\" option to specify the command that needs to be executed to install the required software in our container image. If you don't have any experience with RHEL, we're just using the dnf command to update all packages, install httpd and clean the cache (this last step is used only to have lighter container image).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the httpd package is installed we would like to customize the message that our containerized web server will show to the world. For that we used the \"COPY\" command. This command will copy a file from our local directory into the container that we are building. For our container we are passing a file index.html from our local directory to the directory /var/www/html/ inside the container. We do this because we know that httpd uses that file to define the content to be posted through our web server.\n",
    "If we want it to work we will need to create the index.html file so it can the be copied inside the container once we build it. Let's do it."
