    "# What is Podman?\n",
    "\n",
    "As described by the Podman website itself it is:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Podman is a daemonless, open source, Linux native tool designed to make it easy to find, run, build, share and deploy applications using Open Containers Initiative (OCI) Containers and Container Images. Podman provides a command line interface (CLI) familiar to anyone who has used the Docker Container Engine. Most users can simply alias Docker to Podman (alias docker=podman) without any problems. Similar to other common Container Engines (Docker, CRI-O, containerd), Podman relies on an OCI compliant Container Runtime (runc, crun, runv, etc) to interface with the operating system and create the running containers. This makes the running containers created by Podman nearly indistinguishable from those created by any other common container engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "With simple words it's a container engine that is so similar to Docker that you can just use an alias and run docker-like commands. This brings to mind an obvious question, if it's so similar to Docker why would you use Podman instead? The answer is security.\n",
    "The previous paragraph starts describing Podman as a \"daemonless\" container engine and that's the main difference with Docker. Later in this workshop we'll explain security features in Podman, for the moment just keep in mind that as Podman doesn't have a daemon it doesn't need to use the root user for anything, therefore the execution of containers is secured by design.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is explained differently in Podman website:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Containers under the control of Podman can either be run by root or by a non-privileged user. Podman manages the entire container ecosystem which includes pods, containers, container images, and container volumes using the libpod library. Podman specializes in all of the commands and functions that help you to maintain and modify OCI container images, such as pulling and tagging. It allows you to create, run, and maintain those containers and container images in a production environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, podman has gone further and brings some new functionalities that will help enterprises looking at container adoption for their workloads. We will explain some of these during this workshop.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why Podman?\n",
    "\n",
    "Many think of Podman to be a replacement for Docker (if they have heard of Podman at all). But, this is not the case, as Podman is another option that provides better security and developer features. Podman is a cloud-native, daemonless tool that helps developers manage their Linux containers. Podman is all about security, but also minimizing the friction between your local development environment and production.\n",
    "\n",
    "Podman uses a microservices approach, creating a network with many other cloud-native products, such as Buildah and Skopeo, to build and push containers. This makes Podman a lighter and faster application than Docker, allowing for customization and changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Podman hello world: pulling and executing your first container image\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like any other container engine, Podman has the ability to manage and execute container images. A container image is a static image that contains an applications with all it's dependencies. Because the dependencies are included within the container image we can expect the same application behaviour if it's executed in different hosts, solving one of the most widespread problems for developers: \"it worked in my environment\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Container images are stored in container registries, by default Podman will look for container images in quay.io, registry.redhat.io and docker.io. You can configure additional registries by modifying the file /etc/containers/registries.conf, we'll not cover this advanced configuration during this workshop.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way Podman works with container images is it locally downloads (or pulls) images from registry. Hence, first thing we want to do is checking if we have any image downloaded locally:"
