    "# Podman ecosystem\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen what an awsome piece of software Podman is, but that is not all. Podman counts with some other tools in its ecosystem that makes everything run smoothly.\n",
    "Lets review all of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Managing multiple containers: podman compose and kubernetes\n",
    "\n",
    "Running a single container with podman is just fine, we have demonstrated how simple it is througout this workshop. But, what happens if I want to run multiple containers simultaneously? Do you need to execute them one by one?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the tool podman compose to execute multiple containers in a single command. Podman compose is a tool that helps you defining the list of containers and all of their configuration in a text file written in yaml format. Then you can choose to execute, stop, remove, update and so on all of the containers defined in the file at once. Podman compose is a very powerful tool but it's limited to a single system.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're looking at deploying your containers in multiple systems simultaneously in order to get high availability then you will most probably end up using kubernetes as it has become the standard platform for running containerized workloads in the enterprise.\n",
    "Kubernetes, same as podman composer, uses yaml files to define the desired state of your containerized workloads and, once you pass the file to the control plane nodes of kubernetes, it will make sure your containers run following your specifications and they will be able to run in any of the nodes that are part of your kubernetes cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "![k8slogo](Pictures/kubernetes-logo.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, transitioning from single system container engines like Podman or Docker to kubernetes may not always be easy. That is why Podman can generate a kubernetes yaml file from the container that you are running righ now with Podman. First you just need to execute a new container:"

    "Skopeo is a tool for manipulating, inspecting, signing, and transferring container images and image repositories on linux systems, Windows and MacOS. Like Podman and Buildah, Skopeo is an open source community-driven project that does not require running a container daemon.\n",
    "\n",
    "With Skopeo, you can inspect images on a remote registry without having to download the entire image with all its layers, making it a lightweight and modular solution for working with container images across different formats, including Open Container Initiative (OCI) and Docker images.\n",
    "\n",
    "![skopeologo](Pictures/skopeo.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases you will find Skopeo a super useful tool to manage container images that are stored in remote registries without pulling them to your system. For example you can inspect a remote container by using the command \"skopeo inspect\". First lets make sure that the image we will be inspecting is not locally stored in our system."
