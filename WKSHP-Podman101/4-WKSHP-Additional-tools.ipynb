    "## Managing multiple containers: podman compose and kubernetes\n",
    "\n",
    "Running a single container with podman is just fine, we have demonstrated how simple it is througout this workshop. But, what happens if I want to run multiple containers simultaneously? Do you need to execute them one by one?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the tool podman compose to execute multiple containers in a single command. Podman compose is a tool that helps you defining the list of containers and all of their configuration in a text file written in yaml format. Then you can choose to execute, stop, remove, update all of the containers defined in the file at once. Podman compose is a very powerful tool but it's limited to execute on a single system.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're looking at deploying your containers in multiple systems simultaneously in order to get scalability and high availability then you will most probably end up using kubernetes as it has become the standard platform for running containerized workloads in the enterprise.\n",
    "Kubernetes, same as podman composer, uses yaml files to define the desired state of your containerized workloads and, once you pass the file to the control plane nodes of kubernetes, it will make sure your containers run according to your specifications. Furthermore they will be spread accross all the nodes that are part of your kubernetes cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "![k8slogo](Pictures/kubernetes-logo.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, transitioning from single system container engines like Podman or Docker to kubernetes may not always be easy. That is why Podman can generate a kubernetes yaml file from the container that you are running righ now with Podman. First you just need to execute a new container:"
