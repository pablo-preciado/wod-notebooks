    "## Managing multiple containers: podman compose and kubernetes\n",
    "\n",
    "Running a single container with podman is just fine, we have demonstrated how simple it is througout this workshop. But, what happens if I want to run multiple containers simultaneously? Do you need to execute them one by one?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the tool podman compose to execute multiple containers in a single command. Podman compose is a tool that helps you defining the list of containers and all of their configuration in a text file written in yaml format. Then you can choose to execute, stop, remove, update all of the containers defined in the file at once. Podman compose is a very powerful tool but it's limited to execute on a single system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets learn how podman-compose can help you deploying multiple containers at once. First we are going to build two containers called \"container-A\" and \"container-B\", for this we will use the same Containerfile that we used in the section 2 of this workshop. But this time the web service will answer \"I'm SERVICE A running in container-A\" when doing a curl to container-A and \"I'm SERVICE B running in container-B\" when running curl against container-B."
