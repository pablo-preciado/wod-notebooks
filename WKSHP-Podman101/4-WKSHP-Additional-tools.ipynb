    "Lets review all of them.\n",

    "## Managing multiple containers: podman compose and kubernetes\n",
    "\n",
    "Running a single container with podman is just fine, we have demonstrated how simple it is througout this workshop, but what happens if I want to run multiple containers simultaneously?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the tool podman compose to do that. Podman compose is a tool that helps you defining the list of containers and all of their configuration in a text file written in yaml format. Then you can choose to execute, stop, remove, update and so on all of the containers defined in the file at once. Podman compose is a very powerful tool but it's limited to a single system.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're looking at deploying your containers in a number of systems in order to get high availability then you will most probably end up using kubernetes as it has become the standard platform for running containerized workloads in the enterprise.\n",
    "Kubernetes, same as podman composer, uses yaml files to define the desired state of your containerized workloads and, once you pass the file to the control plane nodes of kubernetes, it will make sure your containers run following your specifications accross as many nodes as you may have.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, transitioning from single system container engines like Podman or Docker to kubernetes may not always be easy. That is why Podman can generate a kubernetes yaml file from the container that you are running righ now with Podman. First you just need to execute a new container:"
